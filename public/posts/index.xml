      <description>Flipping is a term used primarily in the US to describe purchasing a revenue-generating asset and quickly reselling it for profit.
The term &amp;ldquo;flipping&amp;rdquo; is used by real estate investors to describe &amp;ldquo;residential redevelopment&amp;rdquo;. Redevelopment of distressed or abandoned properties or neighborhoods has sometimes been linked to malicious and unscrupulous acts in the post housing bubble era. The term &amp;ldquo;flipping&amp;rdquo; is frequently used both as a descriptive term for schemes involving market manipulation and other illegal conduct and as a derogatory term for legal real estate investing strategies that are perceived by some to be unethical or socially destructive.</description>

      <title>Business Mergers</title>

      <description>Mergers and acquisitions are transactions in which the ownership of companies, other business organizations or their operating units are transferred or combined.
From a legal point of view, a merger is a legal consolidation of two entities into one entity, whereas an acquisition occurs when one entity takes ownership of another entity&amp;rsquo;s stock, equity interests or assets. From a commercial and economic point of view, both types of transactions generally result in the consolidation of assets and liabilities under one entity, and the distinction between a &amp;ldquo;merger&amp;rdquo; and an &amp;ldquo;acquisition&amp;rdquo; is less clear.</description>
