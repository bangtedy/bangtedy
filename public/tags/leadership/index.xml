      <description>As a manager, Nala knows by her vein that she can’t anticipate everything. From her experience, sometimes risks can’t be managed; they simply must be lived.
For the current situation, she is aware that there are no simple solution. She will not avoid it but embrace that turbulence, trust and test her intuition.
As the survival of organization is at stake, her leadership is in test. Summoning up such courage is a highly personal act.</description>
