      <description>Mergers and acquisitions are transactions in which the ownership of companies, other business organizations or their operating units are transferred or combined.
From a legal point of view, a merger is a legal consolidation of two entities into one entity, whereas an acquisition occurs when one entity takes ownership of another entity&amp;rsquo;s stock, equity interests or assets. From a commercial and economic point of view, both types of transactions generally result in the consolidation of assets and liabilities under one entity, and the distinction between a &amp;ldquo;merger&amp;rdquo; and an &amp;ldquo;acquisition&amp;rdquo; is less clear.</description>
