      <description>Flipping is a term used primarily in the US to describe purchasing a revenue-generating asset and quickly reselling it for profit.
The term &amp;ldquo;flipping&amp;rdquo; is used by real estate investors to describe &amp;ldquo;residential redevelopment&amp;rdquo;. Redevelopment of distressed or abandoned properties or neighborhoods has sometimes been linked to malicious and unscrupulous acts in the post housing bubble era. The term &amp;ldquo;flipping&amp;rdquo; is frequently used both as a descriptive term for schemes involving market manipulation and other illegal conduct and as a derogatory term for legal real estate investing strategies that are perceived by some to be unethical or socially destructive.</description>
