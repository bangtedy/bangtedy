Ale: Ka, agama kita mengajarkan bahwa setiap diri kita adalah pemimpin dan setiap diri kita akan diminta tanggung jawab tentang itu.

Kaka: Yes, leadership is about activity and responsibility. A president and a tukang becak can both lead. They have to take action and be responsible for their action. Sooner or later, one can't escape responsibility for taking action in their life. That is why each of us must learn how to take action.

Ale: Terdengar klise ya...sebelum memimpin orang lain harus bisa memimpin diri sendiri. Darimana kita mulai belajar memimpin diri sendiri?

Kaka: Start from the inner work of leadership: seeing ourselves in an objective way. Leaders need to understand themselves, their own motivation, strengths, weaknesses, interest, and abilities before leading others.

Ale: Ya, instropeksi diri karena kita semua adalah pemimpin sesuai levelnya.

Kaka: Exactly, leadership is an activity of a citizen from any walk of life mobilizing people to do something useful and elevate them to a higher moral standard.

Ale: Bisakah kita obyektif pada diri sendiri ya Kak?

Kaka: :flushed:

> All of you are shepherds and every one of you is responsible for his herd. A leader is a shepherd, a man is the shepherd over his family and a woman is the shepherd over her husbandâ€™s house and his children. So all of you are shepherds, and every one of you is responsible for his herd.
