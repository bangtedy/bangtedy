As a manager, Nala knows by her vein that she can't anticipate everything. From her experience, sometimes risks can't be managed; they simply must be lived.  
For the current situation, she is aware that there are no simple solution. She will not avoid it but embrace that turbulence, trust and test her intuition.

As the survival of organization is at stake, her leadership is in test. Summoning up such courage is a highly personal act. It is a matter of courage: a willingness to take the risks; to make judgments with no data or, at best, inadequate data. She will never know if she will be able to do it until the moment of truth arrived.

The road ahead will not be easy. Opposition is for sure. Thus, she has to know how to manage the tension between persevering in the face of opposition, and on the other, responding to it. However, she decides to bring out opposition and resistance out into the open so it can be debated and addressed. Doing so can help her to understand the fears, concerns, and perspective of her colleagues in the company.

This will also help her to differentiate between legitimate critics and mere excuses. Constructive critics can be extremely unpleasant to hear and blunt. Excuse maker by contrast often phrase their objections in ways that seem reasonable, even innocuous but it is just a sign that they are trying to sabotage her move.

In the worst scenario, people from other divisions may think that she's crazy. But, she is not afraid to that perception. She always remembers her father once said that a genuine leader must always be prepared to act alone.
