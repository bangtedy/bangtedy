One Saturday afternoon Boer meets Kaka at Bungurasih bus station on his daily commuting to Malang.

Boer: Assalamualaikum, wie gehts?

Kaka: Waalaikum salam, alhamdulillah, ça va?

Boer: Alhamdulillah, sehr gut.

Kaka: It seems that some leaders have suffered a moral collapse, a crisis of moral judgment...

Boer: Ya, the drama of corruption and power plays out on stages large and small across the globe regardless of region, nation, culture, or industry in both the private and public sectors.

Kaka: Right, we barely surprise by corrupt leaders. For some, not all, once they are in power, such personal financial gain, kick-backs and nepotism then become common practices and they fail to orient to the common good...

Boer: For this particular kind of persistent problem we can't solve it by the application of current technical know-how or routine behaviour. We may not be able to rely on current leaders either.

Kaka: Yeah... a leader is not a magician who will come in and do all the work with as little effort from us as possible. Wir brauchen...to inclusively engage the assets of diverse community members and groups...ein Zusammenspiel dieser Aktuere (~~iki bener gak yo coro jermane~~)...to enlist collaboration across the many systems, aber...

Boer: Wir alle… and each of us have some circle of influence where it is possible to take responsibility to minimize corruption. We have to start to do it from each of us.

Kaka: Oui, c'est ça, social change has always been the result of ordinary people doing extraordinary things -the acts of many, not just the heroic acts of a few leaders.

Boer: Ya, each one of us is a shepherd- personal or social. And we need to maintain this sense of urgency and instill this sense to public, to create a general climate of urgency. Without this general climate of urgency- the feeling that we must change- the society may do nothing until it is too late.
