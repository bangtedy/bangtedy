Ning: Mas Boer! Kepemimpinan yang mimpin itu seperti apa sih?

Boer: Working leadership removes cynicism, paranoia, and self-interest, but foster trust and cooperation.

Ning: Baru baca buku Simon Sinek ya :laughing: [Leaders Eat Last]( https://www.amazon.com/Leaders-Eat-Last-Together-Others/dp/1543614620)

Boer: Effective leadership requires that leaders know how others react to them, what others expect from them, whether people believe they are doing a good job, whether people trust them.

Ning: Berarti supaya efektif pemimpin itu harus punya hati yang peka dengan perasaan rakyat ya Mas Boer?

Boer: Exactly because that is the basis to build trust. Both leaders and leadership are required because we want to move somewhere better...toward cita-cita luhur bangsa kita.

Ning: maksudnya gimana Mas Boer?

Boer:If everything in Indonesia is good, if there is no need for change, then leadership would not be needed.

Ning: Ngomong apa sih Mas Boer, perubahan kan suatu keniscayaan?

Boer: If we had leaders but we move nowhere, we might choose the wrong ones or their leadership is not effective.

Ning: Lha kepemimpinan yang efektif itu apa sih?

Boer: Effective leadership requires that leaders know how others react to them, what others expect from them, whether people believe they are doing a good job, whether people trust them.

Ning: Berarti supaya efektif pemimpin itu harus punya hati yang peka dan mau mendengar rakyat ya Mas Boer? Kalo rakyat gak percaya ama pemimpinnya, sebenarnya pemimpin itu mimpin siapa mas Boer?

Boer: No matter how friendly some leaders are, it doesn't matter until they're relevant to the people they lead. Relevance is built when the leaders and people have mutual interest. It's the leaders responsibility to find areas of mutual interest with those they lead...at least become interested in things that matter to them...genuinely interested in other peoples...make other people important and do that sincerely.  This is the basis to build trust. Leadership is not merely ensures rules and procedures are efficiently carried out. Surely it includes productivity goals, but it is more than that. Fundamentally it deals with people in relationship.

Ning: Kalo pemimpinnya memang gak mau mendengar keluhan rakyatnya gimana Mas Boer, padahal pemimpin itu katanya makannya terakhir (setelah rakyatnya makan)?

Boer: :grin:
