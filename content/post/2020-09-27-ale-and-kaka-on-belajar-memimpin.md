Ale: Ternyata belajar memimpin itu gak gampang ya Ka.

Kaka: Human being is complex. In leadership we deal with that and add with human relations complexity.

Ale: Harus banyak lagi baca buku tentang leadership!

Kaka: You are not wrong. One claim is that leadership is a matter of techniques, a set of skills that can be taught. If you read the right books or take the right training courses, it should be relatively easy to become a leader. But it is not the end of story.

Ale: Belajar memimpin diri sendiri saja sudah sulit...opomaneh mimpin orang lain.

Kaka: Exactly, learning how to lead is more in the nature of cultivating personal wisdom than it is of acquiring technical skills. No matter how much training you have or how much books you have read, nothing can fully prepare you for the challenge.

Ale: "Mmm"

Kaka: In this respect, leadership isn't easy, it's unavoidably difficult. And the most essential things about it cannot really be taught...although they can be learned. Wis lah...aku tak berangkat dulu...gelar dagangan. Entar disambung lagi."

Ale: Iye Kak...ngasteteh (Madurese)... Translation: OK take care.
