Ning: Mas Boer! Kita ini di Indonesia perlu pemimpin gak ya?

Boer: Yes, as a nation, Indonesia has a demand to make things better..leaders to fix things up, make people's life better. Then someone will supply it or invited to lead (at the right price).  That is the law of supply and demand playing out.

Ning: Pemimpin yang kayak apa yang cocok untuk Indonesia sekarang Mas Boer?

Boer: Indonesia is waiting the roles of a strong leadership to be played: making hard decisions, take control, fight for our rights and come up with innovative solutions to our problems.

Ning: Nahâ€¦yang sekarang ini , pemimpin-pemimpin kita gimana Mas Boer?

Boer: Ning, a leader is not a magician who will come in and do all the work with as little effort from us as citizen as possible. We have to take part in making Indonesia better.

Ning: Mas Boer nih jawabnya muter-muter

Boer: :wink: :grinning:
