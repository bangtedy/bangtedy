abstract = "In a supply chain, power can be seen as a mechanism for achieving co-ordination, co-operation or forced collaboration amongst channel members. However, power also affects the expectations of the two parties as to what share should of the value be returned to them. As a supply chain encompasses multiple organisations and participants, the potential for conflict grows because its sources are embedded in the interaction system: functional differentiation between parties, actorsâ€™ heterogeneity, rewards and value sharing, forms and use of power. In the context of agribusiness supply chains, it is argued that an evaluation of performance is an attempt to determine how well the chain meets the expectations of the stakeholders involved."
