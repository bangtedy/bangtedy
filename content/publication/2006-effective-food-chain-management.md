abstract = "Carrying out activity efficiently, closing gaps between existing actorsâ€™ abilities and those required by the end customer, and a trusted relationship among actors is central to developing an effective fresh fruit supply chain management. A high level of certain activity cost in the chain could indicate the inefficiency built into that activity. The perishable nature of fresh fruit made particular actors in the chain can damage all the efforts taken in another stage to deliver more value to customers. To develop such effective supply chain requires hard work, commitment and a fair degree of trust."
