As data, the following may be *instantaneous* such as the viscosity of a chemical product at the
point in time where it is measured; it may be *cumulative* such as the total sales of a product during the month; or it may be a statistic that reflects an *activity* of one variable during a time period, such as the daily closing price of a specific stock on the Jakarta Stock Exchange.

My name is Tedy Herlambang, a *Pendalungan*, speak both Javanese and Madurese, and a little Sundanese. I use R and Python for finance and fun (*activity*). I graduated from IPB University and worked in academia. 

I have written books _Ekonomi Manajerial dan Strategi Bersaing_; and _Ekonomi Mikro Suatu Pendekatan Praktis_ & _Ekonomi Mikro Sebuah Kajian Komprehensif_ with Said Kelana, Sugiarto, Brastoro and Rachmat Sudjana (*cumulative*). 

I live in Paiton Jawa Timur, with my wife, two kids, and our five cats: max, mayo, jurgen, jeff jupri and bite (*instantaneous* :)). You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/t_hlb) and [GitHub](https://github.com/bangtedy).
