The following may be *cumulative*, like monthly electricity consumption; or it may be a statistic that reflects *activities*, such as the daily closing values of stocks on the Indonesia Stock Exchange :).

I use R and Python for finance and fun (*activities*). I graduated from IPB University and work in academia.

I have written books *Ekonomi Manajerial dan Strategi Bersaing*; and *Ekonomi Mikro Suatu Pendekatan Praktis* & *Ekonomi Mikro Sebuah Kajian Komprehensif* with Said Kelana, Sugiarto, Brastoro and Rachmat Sudjana (*cumulative*).

I live in Paiton (read like Python) Jawa Timur, with my wife, two kids, and our five cats: Max, Mayo, Jurgen, Jeff Jupri and Bite. You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/t_hlb) and [GitHub](https://github.com/bangtedy).
